## Prerequisites

To build and run this project, you need:

C++ Compiler: A compiler that supports C++11 or later (e.g., GCC, Clang).

CMake: To handle the build process (usually bundled with the IDE).

SFML Library (v2.x or later): The development libraries for SFML must be installed on your system and accessible to CMake.

## Building and Running (For CLion Users)

If you are using the CLion IDE, the build process is handled automatically by the IDE.

Step 1: Clone and Open

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Open the project in CLion by selecting the top-level directory containing the CMakeLists.txt file.

Step 2: Build and Run

CLion will automatically detect the CMakeLists.txt file and configure the project. Wait for the configuration to finish (it often generates the cmake-build-debug directory).

Select the particle_simulator target from the configuration dropdown menu (usually next to the green hammer/play icons).

Click the Run (green Play triangle) button.

The simulator window should open immediately.
